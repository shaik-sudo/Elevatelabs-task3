# Elevatelabs-task3
##Objective: Use SQL to analyze an eCommerce-style dataset.

## Dataset
I created a small eCommerce database with the following tables:
- #Customers: Basic info about customers (ID, name, country)
- #Products: Product catalog with prices
- #Orders: Purchase records linking customers to products

## Tools Used
- MySQL (via [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/))
- SQL (for queries and analysis)

## What I Did
1. #Created and inserted sample data into three tables: Customers, Products, Orders.
2. #Wrote SQL queries to:
   - Filter records using `WHERE`
   - Join multiple tables
   - Aggregate data using `SUM`, `AVG`
   - Use `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
   - Create and query `VIEWS`
   - Perform subqueries
3. **Saved screenshots** of query results.
4. **Uploaded everything** to this GitHub repository.
